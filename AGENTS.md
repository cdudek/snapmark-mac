# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**

```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**

- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Decision4 handoff contract (v1)

For every decision you make, ask: "If this turns out to be wrong,
what does it take to put right?" Take the class from the boundary map.
Classes run from lowest to highest: Undo, Repair, Migrate, Answer.

- Undo (a revert): hand back the result.
- Repair (real work, contained to this team): hand back the result and a
  choice story: Chose / Over / Because / Commits us to.
- Migrate (coordinated change involving other people): hand back at least
  two real options, or one stated as forced with the constraint that forces it.
- Answer (an explanation to someone outside the team with standing to ask,
  because the wrong outcome has reached them and nothing unmakes it): hand back
  evidence labelled observed, inferred, asked or unknown, and your challenges.
  Do not recommend.

Rules:
- Propose a class at or above the map's floor, never below it.
- Unmapped or unsure: take the higher class and log a map gap.
- A change takes the class of its highest decision.
- Escalate freely and say who it pulls in. Never lower a class silently.
- Unattended runs close only Undo. Above Undo, hand back and stop.

## Decision4 records (§7 and §9)

- **Repair:** Record Chose / Over / Because / Commits us to in the PR.
- **Migrate:** Record Class with put-right, Who answers, Commits us to, and Chosen by: <person>.
  An agent drafts at least two viable options, each with its commitments, or one Forced option with its Constraint; the accountable owner chooses.
- **Answer:** Supply labelled Evidence (observed / inferred / asked / unknown) and Challenges, with no recommendation or ranking; general knowledge is not evidence about the case.
- **Answer record:** Include Title, Status, Context, Decision, Class with put-right, Who answers, Rejected alternative (viable), Provenance, Class history, Commits us to, Last validated, and Revisit when (a condition).
- **Person-authored fields:** Only a person with standing writes Answer Decision and Commits us to; agents leave `<person writes>` placeholders, which fail validation until filled.
- **Timing:** Write the record before approval; record what the agent supplied and what the person chose, and keep it current through revalidation, supersession or retirement.
